#Learning By Doing

A repository with code that I write while learning how to program. It is meant as a reference that I can refer to later if I need a refresher on anything, as well as a place to put code that doesn't quit warrant an entire repository. In addition, there might be something here that others may find useful.

As of now I am focusing on building physics simulations, and doing web development.

The following is an index of some of the code included in this repository:

###Scientific Computing Project 

The final project in a scientific computing class. The program was a 2-d simulation of the rings of Saturn, which was developed in a Unix environment in C. In order to visually display the simulation, PGPlot must be installed.

###Snake Clone

A clone of the classic snake game written in Python, which uses the Pygame library to display graphics.

###Project Euler

My solutions for the problems in Project Euler
