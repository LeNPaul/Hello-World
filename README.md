# Hello World!

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a catch-all for all of the code that I write while learning how to program. It is meant as a reference that I can refer to later if I need a refresher on anything, as well as a place to put code that doesn't quite warrant an entire repository. In addition, there might be something here that others may find useful.

The following is an index of some notable code included in this repository:

### Scientific Computing Project 

The final project in a scientific computing class I took as a undergraduate physics student. The program was a 2-d simulation of the rings of Saturn, which was developed in a Unix environment in C. In order to visually display the simulation, PGPlot must be installed.

### deltaHacks2016

For McMaster deltaHacks 2016

The idea for our build was an Android app that could track when a person has woken up, using the accelerometer on the Android phone. The app would then send a signal through Bluetooth to an Arduino microcontroller that controled a motor that would turn on a coffeemaker.

### Snake Clone

A clone of the classic snake game written in Python, which uses the Pygame library to display graphics.

### chessAI

Attempt at creating a chess game engine.

### Project Euler

My solutions for the problems in Project Euler
