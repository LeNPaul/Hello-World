# Hello World!

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a catch-all for all of the code that I write while learning how to program. It is meant as a reference that I can refer to later if I need a refresher on anything, as well as a place to put code that doesn't quite warrant an entire repository. In addition, there might be something here that others may find useful.

As of now I am focusing on building physics simulations, and doing web development.

The following is an index of some notable code included in this repository:

### Scientific Computing Project 

The final project in a scientific computing class I took as a undergraduate physics student. The program was a 2-d simulation of the rings of Saturn, which was developed in a Unix environment in C. In order to visually display the simulation, PGPlot must be installed.

### deltaHacks2016

For McMaster deltaHacks 2016

The idea for our build was an Android app that could track when a person has woken up, using the accelerometer on the Android phone. The app would then send a signal through Bluetooth to an Arduino microcontroller that controled a motor that would turn on a coffeemaker.

### Snake Clone

A clone of the classic snake game written in Python, which uses the Pygame library to display graphics.

### chessAI

Attempt at creating a chess game engine.

### Project Euler

My solutions for the problems in Project Euler
