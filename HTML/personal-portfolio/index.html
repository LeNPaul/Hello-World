<div class="wrap">This paragraph is filler text. It is impermanent. I tried very little to make it interesting. As of this writing I believe I am a bipedal animal who is having the subject experience of billions of neurons firing simultaneously giving rise to the illusion of consiousness. I also have a computer on my lap. This website is where I share to a small audience the bits and bloops of my creative output. By the very nature of a portfolio, I feel I am an active participant in some weird narcissism. I will do my best to come to terms with this.</div>
